# Streaming Classification of Variable Stars

This is a part of the implemention of my paper [Streaming Classification of Variable Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02235).

In `src/features` you can see the implementation of the streaming features.

Extract macho features in a streaming way:

```
python src/experiments/macho_features.py /home/lukas/universidad/magister/streaming-bayesian/data/macho-raw /home/lukas/universidad/magister/streaming-bayesian/results --n-processes 2
```

## Important!

This repository is missing the classification experiments. I hope to upload that code soon (I had that code in another computer that I don't have access right now).
